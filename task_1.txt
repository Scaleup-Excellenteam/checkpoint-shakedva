Part 1:

Task 1:
1. Kernel modules, also called drivers, are pieces of code that expands the kernel. 
2. The advantage of kernel modules is their performence and that the modules can be compiled and run while the kernel is running, not need to reboot.
   The disadvantage is that when working with the kernel, it can cause the operating system to carsh or reboot. 
3. The relationship between the kernel and the kernel modules is that the kernel modules expands the kernel with additional code. 
4. For examples: adding system calls, the file system and virtualization.
